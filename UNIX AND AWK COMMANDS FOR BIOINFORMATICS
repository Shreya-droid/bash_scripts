1) To get the length of each gene in fasta file:
awk '/^/{if (l!="") print l; print; l=0; next}{l+=length($0)}END{print l}' final_capnocytophaga.fasta

2) To find the occurences of some particular character in fasta file:
grep -o "-" final_capnocytophaga.fasta|wc -l

3) To rename a blast filename { -n: print renaming files without actually renaming them }
rename -n 's/protein$//&s/_protein//' *
rename 's/protein$//&s/_protein//' *

4) To rename the last '_' from the filename
